🧮 Calculation Logic

📘 Grade System (Based on Average Marks)

Average	Grade

≥ 90	A+
≥ 80	A
≥ 70	B
≥ 60	C
≥ 50	D
< 50	FAIL

📗 CGPA Formula

CGPA = (Sum of Grade Points) / Number of Subjects

Grade Points:

Grade	Point

O	10

A+	9

A	8.5

B+	8

B	7

C	6

P	5

F	0

📙 Engineering Cutoff Formula

Cutoff = (Maths / 2) + (Physics / 4) + (Chemistry / 4)
